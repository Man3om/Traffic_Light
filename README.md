# Traffic_Light
Implement Taffic Light Using Tm4c123GH6PM (Tiva C).

# Objectives
The goal of this project is to design a traffic light control system. The system contains simply two traffic lights. One allows cars to move from
north to south, and the other one allows cars to move from east to west. Beside each traffic there is also a pedestrian traffic light. The
pedestrian has to press on a button to have his light green to cross the street safely.

# Specifications
Using two timers to configure the span of the traffic lights.

Using LEDs as outputs, and push buttons as input.

Using interrupts also in this project for the push buttons and timers.
